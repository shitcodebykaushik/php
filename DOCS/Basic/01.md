# PHP 
- PHP Opening Tag
  - A php script can be written anywhere in the documents,and it signifies the start of the PHP script code .
  ```php
  <?php?>
  ```
  - PHP Closing Tag end the php code .
  
  ```php
  ?>
  ```
# ECHO 
- PHP uses the built-in function called echo in order to display one or more strings .
 ```php
 echo "Hello";
 ```
 - echo is not really function . And it is faster than the printf() function .
# Variables 
 - It is named piece of computer memory,containing some information inside it .
 - To declare the variable in the php we use the `$` sign  .
 - `$my_variable`
 - PHP often performs type juggling automatically, but explicit casting ensures your variables are of the desired type. 
 - `NULL`
   - It can be assigned to any variable . It represents a variable with the no value .
 - Boolean 
   - This is the simplest data type with only two possible values .
     - true 
     - false
     ```php
     <?php
     $foo = true;
     $bar = false;
     ?>
     ```
   - Booleans is use to control the flow of the program .
 - `Integer` 
   - PHP supports unsigned integers .This means that an integer can be positive or negative as each integer will contains information about its positivity or negativity . 
   ```php
      $intNumner= 1000;
       $charName= 'N';
      $boolAccept= true;
      $floatNum= 10.292;
      echo $intNumner,",",$charName,",",$boolAccept,",",$floatNum;
     
   
   ``` 
   `{}` Using this is only mandatory when the name of the variable is itself an expression .
# Operators 
- An operator is something that takes one or more values and yeilds them into the new values .
  - There are different types of the operator available we have 
     - Arithmatic operator => In airthmatic we have the two different types of the operator 
      Binary (+,-,*,/,%) and the 
     -  Unary operator (++,--) => In this airthematic operator that perform airthematic on only one value . Ther are two operators only .
       - Increament operator (++)
       - Decreament operator (--)
     - Comparison operator  (==,===,!==,)
     - Logical operator  &&[and] and || [or] are the two different types of the operator .
       - And operator returns the true if all the statements are true then only its value is true.
       ```php
      <?php
      $value = 58;
      $value2 = 200;
      if ($value>$value2) {
      echo "Value is greater than value 2";
      }
      else {
      echo "Value is less than value  2";
      }
      ?> 
      <?php
       $value = True;
       $value2 = false;
       if ($value || $value2){
      echo "True";
      } else {
      echo "False";
      }
      ?>
       ```
       - `Or` operator means if one or more of the conditional statements are true .
     - Assignment operator => `Basic` and the `Combined` are the two .
- Operators presedence determine which operators is performed firts in an expression with more than one value .
- Spaceship is the special type of the operator in the php we have . 
  - returns -1 if the first expression is lesser than the second one .
  - reutrns 1 if the expression is greater than the second expression .
  - return 0 if the first expression is equal to the second expression .
```php
<?php
$f = false and true ;
?>
```
# Constant 
Constant,by defination means a variable that cannot be modified during the execution of the script . They are created using the const statement or the define function .
```php
<?php
const PI = 3.14; // float
define("EARTH_IS_FLAT", false); // boolean
const UNKNOWN = null; // null
define("APP_ENV", "dev"); // string
const MAX_SESSION_TIME = 60 * 60; // integer, using (scalar) expressions is ok
const APP_LANGUAGES = ["de", "en"]; // arrays
define("BETTER_APP_LANGUAGES", ["lu", "de"]); // arrays
?>
```
- We cant use the function call  with the const .
- Some constant name are reserved by PHP and cannot be redefined . 
# Data types
- Void is not the data type in the php .
# Condition 
- Within PHP programming language the simples and the most useful way of creating a branch within the programm is `if-else` statement .
```php
<?php
$f = 4;
$h = 2;
if ($f == 3) {
    echo "This is ok ";
} else if ($h == $f) 
{
    echo "This is not";
}else {
    echo "Am sure This is ok for the conditional statement";
}
?>
```
- The switch case construct PHP is a control structure that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression . It is the alternative of the `if-eleseif-else` statement when comparing the same variable or expression against multiple values. 
# Switch Statement 
- It is control structure used to used execute different blocks of code based on the value a single expression . Its similar `if-elseif` statement but is more concise and readable when comparing the same expression against mulyiple values . 
- The default statement within a switch block provides a fallback case that executes when none of the specified case values match given expression .
```php

<?php
$day = "Monday1";
switch ($day) {
    case "Monday1":
        echo "IT working day";

break;
    case "Monday";
     echo "The days is labour day";
break;
default:
echo "It is ok day to sleep";
break;
    }
?>
``` 
# Ternary Operator 
- The ternary operator is the shorthand of the writing conditional statements . It evaluates a condition and returns one of two depending on whether the condition is `true` or `false`
```php
<?php 
$age = 15;
echo ($age <=18) ? "Child" : "Adult";
?>
```
# Loop 
- It allows the programmer to execute the same block of the code repeatedly instead of re-writing code that needs to be executed multiple times .
- `While`
   - It is the control structure that allows code to be executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true .
```php
<?php 
$num1 = 5.5;
$num2 = 6.5;
while ($num1< $num2){
    echo "The ";
}
?>   // This will run till infinite as the the conditon is always true . 
```
- When we want the input but in same code we want it to be in the infinite way 
```php
<?php 
$num1 = null;    // This is something where we are taking input into the variable .
while ($num1 !== ""){
    $num1 = readline();
}
?>
```
- `Do while` 
 - This is different from the while as in this atleat one iteration is performed without cheking the condition .After one iteration it will chek the condition .
```php
<?php 
$num1 = 10;    
do { 
    echo "This will run ";
}while ($num1 == 11);
echo "Loop terminated"
?>
```
- `for`
- A for loop is used for doing a certain amount of time. It like while but with the increament condition included .
- It is posible to do nesting of the with .
- `foreach`  statements is similar to  `for` but `foreach` lacks an iteration indexing .
- The enumaration-expression is the collection on which the iteration will happen so it can be array or list .
# Function 
- A block of code that is written in order to perform a specific .
- In php we have builtin-funtion and user defined function .
- 
```php


``` 
- PHP  allows us pass arguments into a function in two ways:-
  - Pass by value 
  - Pass by reference means  the orginal value is passed,therefore orginal values gets altered,in pass by refernce we can the pass 
# Array 
- An array is the list of values . The simplest form of an array is indexed by an array and ordered by the index . with the first elements lying at the index 0 .
- In php we have the three different types of ARRAY .
 - `Indexed Array` 
   - Array with the numeric keys (indexes) starting from 0 .
   ```php
   <?php
   $fruits= ["Apple","Banana","Orange"];
   echo $fruits[0];
   ?>
   ```
- `Associative Arrays` 
  - Arrays with named keys,where keys are string .
  ```php
  $user = [
    "name" => "John",
    "email" => "john@example.com",
    "age" => 25
    ];
    echo $user["name"]; // Output: John
    <?php
       $kangaroo = "Kanga";
       $$kangaroo = "Roo";
       echo "Hi, I'm ".$kangaroo." and this is ".$Kanga.".";
        ?>
    ```
- `MultiDimensional Array` 
   -  Arrays that contains other arrays as their elements .
   ```php
     $users = [
     ["name" => "John", "age" => 25],
     ["name" => "Jane", "age" => 30],
     ["name" => "Tom", "age" => 35]
     ];
     echo $users[1]["name"]; // Output: Jane
    ```
# String 
- An string is just like a array of the characters . It can be indexed to return its individual characters .
```php
<?php
$foo = "I am string";
echo $foo;
echo "\n";
echo $foo[2];
?>
```
- There are only two string operator.
  - Concatenation(.);
  - Concatenation Assignement(.=).
- Local veriables => The defined within a funtion are inside a local scope .
- Global variables => A gloabal variables can be accessed in any part of the program .
- Single characters can be extracted using array (square brace) synta as well as curly brace syntax .
```php
<?php 
$foo = 'Hello';
$to = "wassup";
echo $foo[4];  // In thr end  simply  call the function
echo strlen($foo);
?>
```
- The length of array  dynamic  and can be changed over time in php .
- PHP allows us to create multidimensional us array , these arrays items that can be a single value or an array an array itself . 
- ` $arrayName = array(array(), array()......array())` 
- It is possible to acces the values in multidmensional arrays .
- PHP built-in function unset() is used to remove an elements from an array . 
- `sort()` is a built-in function in PHP that can be used to sort arrays in ascending order.
- `ksort()` is a built-in function in PHP that can be used to sort an associative array, in ascending order, by key. The associated values are preserved during this sort.
- `array_merge()` is a built-in function in PHP. It is the easiest way to merge two or more arrays.
- 
# Class 
- Classes are the blueprints of objects. One of the big differences between functions and classes is that a class contains both data (variables) and functions to form a package. A class is a user-defined data type, which includes local methods and local variables.
- An object is an individual instance of the data structure defined by a class. We define a class once and then make many objects that belong to that class
- In php objects are divided into two parts .
  - property 
  - method
