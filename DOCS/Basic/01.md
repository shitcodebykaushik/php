# PHP 
- PHP Opening Tag
  - A php script can be written anywhere in the documents,and it signifies the start of the PHP script code .
  ```php
  <?php?>
  ```
  - PHP Closing Tag end the php code .
  
  ```php
  ?>
  ```
# ECHO 
- PHP uses the built-in function called echo in order to display one or more strings .
 ```php
 echo "Hello";
 ```
 - echo is not really function . And it is faster than the printf() function .
# Variables 
 - It is named piece of computer memory,containing some information inside it .
 - To declare the variable in the php we use the `$` sign  .
 - `$my_variable`
 - PHP often performs type juggling automatically, but explicit casting ensures your variables are of the desired type. 
 - `NULL`
   - It can be assigned to any variable . It represents a variable with the no value .
 - Boolean 
   - This is the simplest data type with only two possible values .
     - true 
     - false
     ```php
     <?php
     $foo = true;
     $bar = false;
     ?>
     ```
   - Booleans is use to control the flow of the program .
 - `Integer` 
   - PHP supports unsigned integers .This means that an integer can be positive or negative as each integer will contains information about its positivity or negativity . 
   ```php
   <?php
   $name= kabushiki ;
   $age = 21;
   $debt = 20.45;
   $debit score = -78;
   $password = 0x1021;
   $value = NAN ; // Means Not a number ;
   ?>
   
   ``` 
   `{}` Using this is only mandatory when the name of the variable is itself an expression .
# Constant 
Constant,by defination means a variable that cannot be modified during the execution of the script . They are created using the const statement or the define function .
```php
<?php
const PI = 3.14; // float
define("EARTH_IS_FLAT", false); // boolean
const UNKNOWN = null; // null
define("APP_ENV", "dev"); // string
const MAX_SESSION_TIME = 60 * 60; // integer, using (scalar) expressions is ok
const APP_LANGUAGES = ["de", "en"]; // arrays
define("BETTER_APP_LANGUAGES", ["lu", "de"]); // arrays
?>
```
- We cant use the function call  with the const .
- Some constant name are reserved by PHP and cannot be redefined . 
# Data types
- Void is not the data type in the php .

# Array 
- An array is the list of values . The simplest form of an array is indexed by an array and ordered by the index . with the first elements lying at the index 0 .
- In php we have the three different types of ARRAY .
 - `Indexed Array` 
   - Array with the numeric keys (indexes) starting from 0 .
   ```php
   <?php
   $fruits= ["Apple","Banana","Orange"];
   echo $fruits[0];
   ?>
   ```
- `Associative Arrays` 
  - Arrays with named keys,where keys are string .
  ```php
  $user = [
    "name" => "John",
    "email" => "john@example.com",
    "age" => 25
    ];
    echo $user["name"]; // Output: John
    <?php
       $kangaroo = "Kanga";
       $$kangaroo = "Roo";
       echo "Hi, I'm ".$kangaroo." and this is ".$Kanga.".";
        ?>
    ```
- `MultiDimensional Array` 
   -  Arrays that contains other arrays as their elements .
   ```php
     $users = [
     ["name" => "John", "age" => 25],
     ["name" => "Jane", "age" => 30],
     ["name" => "Tom", "age" => 35]
     ];
     echo $users[1]["name"]; // Output: Jane
    ```
# String 
- An string is just like a array of the characters . It can be indexed to return its individual characters .
```php
<?php
$foo = "I am string";
echo $foo;
echo "\n";
echo $foo[2];
?>
```
