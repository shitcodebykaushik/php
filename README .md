# My PHP Learning Journey 🚀

## 🌟 Welcome to My PHP Chronicles

This repository is a collection of my adventures, challenges, and triumphs as I dive deep into the world of **PHP**, the language that powers the web's backbone. From mastering the basics to exploring the depths of legacy code and modern frameworks, this is my roadmap to becoming a PHP maestro.

   - CRUD operations using SQLite & MySQL.
   - Playing with sessions, cookies, and file uploads.

3. **Legacy PHP Exploration**:
